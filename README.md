# React Gallery App

A simple photo gallery app based on the Flickr API. Project 7 Full Stack JavaScript.

## Made With

- React.js
- React Router
- Flickr API

## Extra Features 
I decided to add pagination to enhance user experience. The Flickr API returns a lot of pages of
results. It is not possible to display all pages, but the gallery will allow users to view up to 25 
pages of results
